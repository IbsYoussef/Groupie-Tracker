# Groupie Tracker

A web-based Go application that visually presents data from a RESTful music artist API. Groupie Tracker displays artist profiles, their members, debut dates, and upcoming tour locations through a clean interface. The project is fully modular, combining Go’s powerful backend capabilities with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic frontend.

## 📝 About

Groupie Tracker is a music-focused web application that fetches and displays data from a third-party API to showcase artists, their members, debut albums, and upcoming tour dates. The project helped me understand how to consume and integrate public APIs, develop a Go backend that communicates with a REST API and display said data, and design a responsive user interface using templating and static assets. It mimics a booking-style showcase for bands/artists and serves as a foundation for future feature-rich web apps.
